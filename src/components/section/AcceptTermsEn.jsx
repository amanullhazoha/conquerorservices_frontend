                    Contract by giving a 14 (Fourteen) day notice. However, the employee may 
                    terminate the Employment Contract during the probation period as per terms of 
                    the local labour laws and with notice period of either 30 days or 14 days (as may

                    commencement of their contract, without prejudice to the first party's legal or 
                    contractual obligations. (The amount agreed on for the value of the training
